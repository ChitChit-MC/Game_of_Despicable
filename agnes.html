    <h1>Agnes Gru</h1>
    <p>
      Agnes is a little girl with dark brown eyes. Her long black hair is tied
      in an upwards ponytail with a bright red scrunchie. Most of the time,
      Agnes wears steel blue overalls over a yellow and brown striped t-shirt,
      and white sneakers with yellow socks. She also wears a white ballet outfit
      like Edith and Margo (at the ballet recital). For pajamas, Agnes wears a
      long blue nightshirt covered with teddy bears and polar bear slippers; her
      hair stays the same. On her birthday, Agnes is wearing a dress that
      resembles a princess riding a unicorn. The colors are similar to her
      regular outfit. She also wears a blue princess hat on her head. Agnes is
      known for shouting so loud it can cause anything such as billboards and
      windows to be destroyed. It was put into good use when she protected
      herself by screaming so loud it cracked Kevin's goggles to give her an
      opportunity to retrieve her stuffed unicorn (Kevin was mutated due to the
      PX-41).
